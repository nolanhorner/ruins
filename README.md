# Ruins
Ruins is an FPS game where players need to collect a gold coin at the top of an ancient tower, but can they make it to the top?

This was my first attempt at creating an FPS game with Unreal Engine 4 and C++.  It is a very simple game, but I learned a lot creating it and had a lot of fun!

If you want to build this game you will need to use UE4 version 4.16.

For people who don't have UE4, here are some pictures of what the game looks like.
